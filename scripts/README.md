Hey! You found the *easy* way to use Apache2. I have made these scripts to easily let people install, and manage their own Apache2 server. I am still learning bash scripts so please bear with me. Feel free to fork this repository, make appropriate edits, and then pull request!

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>How do I use one of these scripts?</h3>

Firstly, either copy the script manually or use
```
git clone https://github.com/mrmagicpie/apache2
``` 
then you'll want to use 
```
sh (file name).sh
``` 
to run the script.

<h3>What do I need to use this?</h3>

All pre-requisits will be shown in the First message sent by the script. Most times, you will need a fully qualified domain name, and an SSL certificate to go with it! 

These scripts are currently only supported on Ubuntu. Feel free to try them on Debian, or any other Linux OS, though I give no garuntee that it will work!

<h2>The scripts don't work!</h2>

Well then, most likely, you're using the script wrong. Please follow the instructions in the script. Feel free to review the script source before trying to use it to make sure you know what you're doing! 

If you really believe the script is broken please feel free to make an issue on this repository directly telling us where the issues are, and how we can reproduce them.
