Hey! You found this? :o This is a work-in-progress project to help people learn the basics of operating an Apache2 server. Currently, I'm only supporting Ubuntu(which may work on Debian but oop). I may support other os's in the future.

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>How do I use one of these scripts?</h3>

Firstly, either copy the script manually or use
```
git clone https://github.com/mrmagicpie/apache2
``` 
then you'll want to use 
```
sh (file name).sh
``` 
to run the script.

<h3>What do I need to use this?</h3>

All pre-requisits will be shown in the First message sent by the script. Most times, you will need a fully qualified domain name, and an SSL certificate to go with it! 

These scripts are currently only supported on Ubuntu. Feel free to try them on Debian, or any other Linux OS, though I give no garuntee that it will work!

SSL can be obtained for free here:

- <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">https://letsencrypt.org</a>

<h2>How to Contribute</h2>

All contributions are welcome! Just fork this repository, and then pull request when you're ready! 

<h2>The scripts don't work!</h2>

Well then, most likely, you're using the script wrong. Please follow the instructions in the script. Feel free to review the script source before trying to use it to make sure you know what you're doing! 

If you really believe the script is broken please feel free to make an issue on this repository directly telling us where the issues are, and how we can reproduce them.
